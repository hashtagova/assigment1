        <p>During the semester, I participated in the Ludum Dare Game Jam where we created a game called "The Price of Art". I contributed to the game as a narrative designer and also helped with the graphic design aspects.</p>
        <p>Here is the <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/55/the-price-of-art">link</a> to the game.</p>

        <p>Wow, I could not even imagine that I would study here! It's been amazing to see how much I've learned already. Between tackling those coding challenges and diving into game design theories, I feel like my brain is exploding with new ideas! I can't wait to see what the future holds in this crazy world of game development.</p>
